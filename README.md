# Enterprise Package API

This Node.js application provides an API for uploading files and fetching JSON data from files stored on the server. It utilizes Express.js for routing, multer for handling file uploads, cors for enabling cross-origin resource sharing, and fs for file system operations.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will start running on port 3000 by default. You can also specify a custom port using the `PORT` environment variable.

## Endpoints

  - No file uploaded: `{ "msg": "No File Uploaded" }`
  - Error: `{ "msg": "Error Occurred" }`

### 2. JSON Data Endpoints

- **URL**: `/commerceToolFlow`, `/hclCommerceFlow`, `/emporixFlow`, `/elasticPathFlow`, `/magento2Flow`, `/contentfulFlow`, `/contentStackFlow`, `/amplienceFlow`, `/acquiaFlow`, `/siteCoreFlow`, `/coreMediaFlow`, `/bloomReachFlow`, `/algoliaFlow`, `/elasticSearchFlow`, `/advanceCommerceFlow`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Fetch JSON data related to specific entities.
- **Response**: JSON data related to the specified entity.

## Storage

Uploaded files are stored in the `Storage` directory relative to the project root.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Web framework for Node.js
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling CORS
- `multer`: Middleware for handling file uploads
- `fs`: Node.js file system module
- `path`: Node.js path module

## Configuration

- The application uses the `PORT` environment variable for defining the server port. If not set, it defaults to port 3000.
- Uploaded files are stored in the `Storage` directory. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

## Notes

- This application is a basic implementation for file upload and JSON data fetching. Additional security measures and error handling can be implemented as needed.
- Ensure proper permissions are set for the `Storage` directory to allow file read and write operations.
